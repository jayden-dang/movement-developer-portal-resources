* Address Object & Create Object
** Summary
- Objects are a key feature in the =aptos_framework=, enhancing code flexibility and adaptability.
- They address limitations of structs such as lack of stable identity, limited extensibility, and data overload.
- Objects maintain stable references, allow potential future extensions, and improve data organization.
- Creation involves using functions like =object::create_object=, which generates a unique address for storing resources.
- The process includes getting the owner's address, creating the object, generating an object signer, and moving the object to its address.
- Different types of objects (normal, named, sticky) can be created with varying properties of deletability and address determinism.

** What is Object?
Objects are one of the most exciting features of the aptos_framework. They make your code extremely flexible and help developers be more adaptable in designing and developing products. Objects are also used in many of Aptos' standard code implementations, such as Digital Assets, Coins, and Fungible Tokens.

In this lesson, we will explore what objects are and how they work.

** Limitations of Structs
Reflecting on our previous lessons about structs, we can see that while using structs and a resource-centric approach has made Move very flexible, there are still several limitations:

1. Lack of Stable Identity: Structs can move freely between resources, making them difficult to track consistently.
2. Limited Extensibility: Once defined, structs cannot be easily extended with new fields, even in upgradable modules.
3. Data Overload: Storing numerous resources in accounts can lead to clutter, making it challenging to locate relevant data for specific decentralized applications (dApps).

*Using objects in this way allows us to:*

1. Maintain a stable reference to our data via the object's address.
2. Potentially extend the object's functionality in future upgrades.
3. Keep related data grouped together, improving organization.

** Create a Object
#+begin_src move
module movement::object_module_entry {
    use aptos_framework::object;
    use std::debug::print;
    use std::signer;

    #[resource_group_member(group = aptos_framework::object::ObjectGroup)]
    struct ExampleObject has key {
        value: u64
    }

    public entry fun example_object(user: &signer, value: u64) {
        let owner_address = signer::address_of(user);
        print(&owner_address);

        let example_object_constructor_ref = &object::create_object(owner_address);
        print(example_object_constructor_ref);

        let object_signer = &object::generate_signer(example_object_constructor_ref);
        print(object_signer);

        move_to(object_signer, ExampleObject { value });

        let address_object = object::address_from_constructor_ref(example_object_constructor_ref);
        print(&address_object);
    }

    #[test(account = @0x1)]
    fun test_example_object(account: &signer) {
        example_object(account, 10);
    }
}
#+end_src

Certainly! I'll provide a step-by-step description of the =example_object= function from the code you've selected. This function demonstrates how to create and use objects:

1. Function Signature:
#+begin_src move
public entry fun example_object(user: &signer, value: u64)
#+end_src

This function takes two parameters: a reference to a signer (the user) and a u64 value.

2. Get the owner's address:
#+begin_src move
let owner_address = signer::address_of(user);
#+end_src

This step retrieves the address of the signer and prints it.

3. Create an object:
#+begin_src move
let example_object_constructor_ref = &object::create_object(owner_address);
#+end_src

Here, a new object is created using the=create_object=function from the=object=module. The constructor reference is stored. This function returns a randomly generated and unique object address. This address will be used to store resources instead of storing them directly in the user's address. This approach reduces the storage burden on user accounts, making it more optimized and flexible.

4. Generate an object signer:
#+begin_src move
let object_signer = &object::generate_signer(example_object_constructor_ref);
#+end_src

This step generates a signer for the object using the constructor reference.

5. Move the ExampleObject to the object's address:
#+begin_src move
move_to(object_signer, ExampleObject { value });
#+end_src

This moves an instance of =ExampleObject= with the given value to the address of the object signer.

6. Get the object's address:
#+begin_src move
let address_object = object::address_from_constructor_ref(example_object_constructor_ref);
#+end_src

Finally, the function retrieves the address of the created object using the constructor reference and prints it.

#+begin_src sh
[debug] @0x1 // Address Signer
[debug] 0x1::object::ConstructorRef { // Create address object
  self: @0xe46a3c36283330c97668b5d4693766b8626420a5701c18eb64026075c3ec8a0a,
  can_delete: true
}
[debug] signer(@0xe46a3c36283330c97668b5d4693766b8626420a5701c18eb64026075c3ec8a0a) // signer
[debug] @0xe46a3c36283330c97668b5d4693766b8626420a5701c18eb64026075c3ec8a0a
#+end_src

7. Additionally, instead of retrieving the object's address, you can also directly obtain the object through this function:
#+begin_src move
let object_info = object::object_from_constructor_ref<ExampleObject>(example_object_constructor_ref);
#+end_src

Finally, the test results will return additional inner objects of that struct:
#+begin_src move
[debug] 0x1::object::Object<0x6f409ba3234fa3b9a8baf7d442709ef51f39284f35dd7c06360fa0b55a0cd690::object_module_entry::ExampleObject> {
  inner: @0xe46a3c36283330c97668b5d4693766b8626420a5701c18eb64026075c3ec8a0a
}
#+end_src

In addition to the =object::create_object= function, we have other functions to create objects:

- =object::create_object=: A normal Object | This type is =deletable= and has a =random address=
- =object::create_named_object= : A named Object | This type is =not deletable= and has a =deterministic address=
- =object::create_sticky_object= : A sticky Object | This type is also =not deletable= and has a =random address=

* Named Objects
** Summary
- Named objects in Move allow for easy retrieval and manipulation of object data
- The module demonstrates creation, retrieval, and modification of a Object
- Named objects use a fixed address, making them more convenient than default or sticky objects
- The module includes test functions to verify correct behavior of main functions
- Global storage methods like =borrow_global= and =borrow_global_mut= are used to access object data

** Named Object

In the previous section, we learned about three types of Objects, among which named objects will likely be the type we use most often because we can initialize an object address that is fixed and can be easily retrieved through the Object Name Address. As for default objects and sticky objects, both create a random address. This makes it difficult to use them for querying or listing information, but they also have their uses in certain cases.

In this section, we will use named objects to easily obtain the address for storing an object.

#+begin_src move
module movement::object_module_entry {
    use aptos_framework::object;
    use std::signer::address_of;
    use std::debug::print;

    const MOVEMENT_OBJECT_NAME: vector<u8> = b"MovementObjectName";

    #[resource_group_member(group = aptos_framework::object::ObjectGroup)]
    struct MovementObject has key {
        value: u64
    }

    fun init_module(owner: &signer) {
        let state_object_constructor_ref = &object::create_named_object(owner, MOVEMENT_OBJECT_NAME);
        let state_object_signer = &object::generate_signer(state_object_constructor_ref);
        move_to(state_object_signer, MovementObject {
            value: 10
        });
    }

    #[test_only]
    fun test_init_module(onwer: &signer) {
        init_module(onwer);
    }

    #[view]
    public fun get_object_address(owner: address): address {
        object::create_object_address(&owner, MOVEMENT_OBJECT_NAME)
    }

    #[test(account = @0x1)]
    fun test_get_object_address(account: &signer) {
        test_init_module(account);
        let owner = address_of(account);
        let addr = get_object_address(owner);
        print(&addr);
    }
}
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
[debug] @0x52152ca68792cb72eb58f6497c1c8fbe69f5fc5d938edf2e74ed8da6ae816622 // Object Address
#+end_src

By using named objects, we can easily access the object and perform changes or view data.

**# Modify & Retrieve Object Value

To modify and retrieve data from objects, we still use global storage methods like =borrow_global= and =borrow_global_mut=.
#+begin_src move
public fun get_value(owner: address): u64 acquires MovementObject {
    borrow_global<MovementObject>(get_object_address(owner)).value
}

public fun set_value(owner: address, new_value: u64) acquires MovementObject {
    let spider_dna = borrow_global_mut<MovementObject>(get_object_address(owner));
    spider_dna.value = new_value;
}
#+end_src

** Full Code
#+begin_src move
module movement::object_module_entry {
    use aptos_framework::object;
    use std::signer::address_of;

    const MOVEMENT_OBJECT_NAME: vector<u8> = b"MovementObjectName";

    #[resource_group_member(group = aptos_framework::object::ObjectGroup)]
    struct MovementObject has key {
        value: u64
    }

    fun init_module(owner: &signer) {
        let state_object_constructor_ref = &object::create_named_object(owner, MOVEMENT_OBJECT_NAME);
        let state_object_signer = &object::generate_signer(state_object_constructor_ref);
        move_to(state_object_signer, MovementObject {
            value: 10
        });
    }

    #[test_only]
    fun test_init_module(onwer: &signer) {
        init_module(onwer);
    }

        object::create_object_address(&owner, MOVEMENT_OBJECT_NAME)
    }

        borrow_global<MovementObject>(get_object_address(owner)).value
    }

    public fun set_value(owner: address, new_value: u64) acquires MovementObject {
        let spider_dna = borrow_global_mut<MovementObject>(get_object_address(owner));
        spider_dna.value = new_value;
    }

    #[test(account = @0x1)]
    fun test_get_object_address(account: &signer) {
        test_init_module(account);

        let value = get_object_address(addr);
        print(&value);
    }

    #[test(account = @0x1)]
    fun test_get_object(account: &signer) acquires MovementObject {
        test_init_module(account);
        let addr = address_of(account);
        let value = get_value(addr);
        assert!(value == 10, 0);
    }

    #[test(account = @0x1)]
    fun test_set_object(account: &signer) acquires MovementObject {
        test_init_module(account);
        let addr = address_of(account);
        set_value(addr, 20);
        let value = get_value(addr);
        assert!(value == 20, 1);
    }
}
